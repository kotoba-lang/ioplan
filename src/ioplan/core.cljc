  "Turning a list of I/O requests into the list the device actually wants.

  Four transformations, and which of them apply is a property of the device
  rather than a preference:

  1. **align** every request to whole device blocks, because a device cannot
     transfer half a block and pretending otherwise hides the amplification;
  2. **merge** adjacent requests, up to the device's maximum transfer, so one
     command carries what several would have;
  3. **order** them — or, on a device with no seek cost, deliberately do not;
  4. **batch** them to the device's queue depth.

  The third is where most of the wrong intuition lives. An elevator sort is
  the canonical I/O optimization and on an NVMe device it is *harmful*: it
  spends CPU and latency to reduce a cost that is zero, and it destroys the
  submission order the caller chose. `machine.core/reorderable?` answers the
  question from the device descriptor, so a plan cannot apply a rotating-disk
  optimization to flash by inheritance.

  Everything is a pure function of requests plus a device descriptor. No I/O
  happens here; the output is a plan a host executes.

  Pure `.cljc`. Depends only on `kotoba-lang/machine`."

  That fairness is not free, and `benefit` prices it. From a head above the

;;
;; Both floors are exact rather than estimated, which is unusual and worth
;; saying: the byte floor is the measure of the union of the aligned ranges,
;; and no plan moves fewer bytes than the bytes it was asked for. The travel
;; floor is the classic shortest walk visiting every point on a line from a

(defn benefit
  "What planning can buy on this request list, before planning it.

  Three comparisons, each against a floor no planner can beat:

  - **bytes** — the union of the aligned ranges. Overlapping requests are the
    only thing merging removes here; alignment overhead is not removable at
    all, so a plan already at this floor cannot be improved by merging.
  - **commands** — one per union run, split at the device's maximum transfer.
  - **travel** — `optimal-travel`, and only for a device that charges for
    seeking. On a zero-seek device this is `nil` rather than zero, because the
    quantity does not apply rather than being minimal.

  `:worth-planning?` is the summary: is the unplanned submission meaningfully
  worse than the floor? When it is false, `plan` will return something correct
  and pointless, and the honest report is that the request list was already
  good.

  **These floors bound MERGING AND ORDERING, not gap bridging, and the
  `:planned` figures here are measured with bridging switched off so the two
  sides describe the same lever.** `plan` bridges gaps smaller than a seek by
  default: it buys a command by transferring bytes nobody asked for, which a
  union-of-ranges floor cannot see and does not bound. Measured on a real
  packfile layout, the default plan issued 73 commands against a floor of 82
  and `:captured :commands` came out at **1.05** — a plan reported as removing
  105% of the removable excess. The floor was not wrong; the comparison was,
  in the same way that running a prefetching cache against a demand-paging
  bound makes LRU beat Belady.

  So `:planned` here is deliberately NOT what `plan` returns by default. To
  reproduce it, pass `{:merge-gap 0}`. To see what bridging buys, compare that
  against the default plan — it is a separate lever with a separate ceiling
  and it belongs in a separate comparison."
